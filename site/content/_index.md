      About us


      One of our founders Suzy who is Dyslexic had a lower reading age by several years then her intellectual ability and mental age. She found as a child lots of the books she read as a child were the right reading ability but the wrong interest age. This left her embarrassed and made reading even more unengaging before. We want people to be proud of who they are not embarrassed.


      Suzy wanted to see if this was just a situation that she was in but found that others had experienced the same. Knowing the importance of reading to peopleâ€™s education. As a stepping stone to further study.  Reading affects communication and essential navigating in the world. The more practice we get in reading the better. 


      Suzy studied Artificial intelligence and realised the impact this could have on app development to increase engagement.


      When Suzy met Peter, an experienced web developer, they believed that these more engaging books and further helpful features for Dyslexic children could be built through a website and app. This was the start of the Yourstories team.


      We are excited to share our journey with you. We hope you will learn more about our reading app. We want to build a further community of support and make sure that children can get all the help they need, see the strengths of Dyslexia and feel proud to be Dyslexic. Ultimately achieve their dreams and not be set back.
