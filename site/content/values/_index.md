      At Your Stories, we know that Dyslexia affects skills involved with fluent
      word reading. With this impact on word fluency, reading aloud can feel
      deeply humiliating and, unfortunately, can lead to bullying. Reading is an
      essential part of learning which leads to qualifications and life chances.
      This struggle often creates disengagement with education.  (UK Rose report
      pg 10-11). Dyslexia can also create emotional barriers to reading (Rose
      report pg 21) The impact of creating a warmer and more engaging way to
      learn reading will help increase learners confidence and their future
      opportunities.

      Personalised learning is important to achieve the best possible progress,
      which is support through the Assessment of Learning and helps track
      progress. Personalised learning means that the pace of study can be
      quickened (footnote in Rose Report UK Page 12-13) 

      Children with Dyslexia benefit from the ‘little and often’ practice of reading. (Rose report UK pg 14)( footer 10 “Phonological skills” consist of identifying and manipulating the sounds in words. An example of having or developing phonological skills is understanding that if the p in pat is changed to an s, the word obtained will be sat. 11 Singleton (2009). 12 Brooks (2007) pp 31 and 32.)
